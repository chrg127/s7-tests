have to do:
- math ops
- more checks when defining ops on usertypes
- add function support inside Variable
- add defines for debug/release

probably won't do soon:
- (possibly) ports
- (possibly) let handling
- (possibly) errors
- hook stuff seems cool but is a feature not attached to anything else?
