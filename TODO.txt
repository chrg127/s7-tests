have to do:
- more checks when defining ops on usertypes
- add function support inside Variable
- add defines for debug/release
- support for creating an s7 function that matches multiple functions
  (same mechanism as constructors, except extended to normal functions)
  (probably only requires a rename for constructor stuff)

probably won't do soon:
- (possibly) ports
- (possibly) let handling
- (possibly) errors
- hook stuff seems cool but is a feature not attached to anything else?
