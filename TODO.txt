have to do:
- add function support inside Variable
- add defines for debug/release

partially completed, not sure if actually completed:
- more checks when defining ops on usertypes
- resolve() (for passing overloaded functions)

probably won't do soon:
- (possibly) ports
- (possibly) let handling
- (possibly) errors
- hook stuff seems cool but is a feature not attached to anything else?
- define function with signatures like (int, float, varargs)
- signature for overloads
