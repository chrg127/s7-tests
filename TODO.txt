- math ops
- more checks when defining ops on usertypes
- function setters
- on the same vein, using dilambda for usertype properties: these can be split from the
  make_usertype() stuff
- (possibly) ports
- (possibly) let handling
- (possibly) errors
- hook stuff seems cool but is a feature not attached to anything else?
- add function support inside Variable
